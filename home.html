                        <p>This is a Plant website that Im working on! </p>
                        <p>This home page was created on 4/22/22. Im going to write  abunch of random stuff until the text wraps
                            around on this thing, it might take a second though so Im absent mindendly
                            just typing my heart out woohoo lets goo, lets bloody gooooo!
                        </p>

                        <p> "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                            and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings
                            of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
                            dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
                            pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                            loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                             occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. 
                             To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to 
                             obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
                             that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
